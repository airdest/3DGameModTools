This merge script is designed for NarakaBladepoint.

For easier to read and understand, I have add a lot of comments in this script,
and I split this script into several part, to be more elegent.
but it's still very hard to understand if you are first time read this kind of vertex merge script.

So before you want to figure out how this script is work, you need a lot of basic knowledge,
which can be found at BasicTutorial folder, especially for Element class, VertexData class and VertexModel class,
if you don't know the basic concept behind it, you almost impossible to understand this script.
